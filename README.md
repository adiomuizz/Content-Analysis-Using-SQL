üîß Technical Stack
SQL (PostgreSQL Syntax)

PostgreSQL functions used: UNNEST, STRING_TO_ARRAY, SPLIT_PART, ILIKE, CAST, CTEs (WITH), and window functions (RANK()).

Database client: pgAdmin, DBeaver, or any PostgreSQL-supported interface.

## üßë‚Äçüíª How to Use

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/netflix-sql-analysis.git cd netflix-sql-analysis.
```
2. Open netflix_analysis.sql in your SQL environment (PostgreSQL preferred).

3. Run the script section-by-section or as a whole for insight generation.


üíæ SQL Script
See the full SQL script in netflix_analysis.sql. It includes:
```bash

-- DROP TABLE IF EXISTS netflix;
CREATE TABLE netflix (
    show_id VARCHAR(7),
    type VARCHAR(10),
    title VARCHAR(160),
    director VARCHAR(210),
    casts VARCHAR(1000),
    country VARCHAR(160),
    date_added VARCHAR(50),
    release_year INT,
    rating VARCHAR(12),
    duration VARCHAR(18),
    listed_in VARCHAR(100),
    description VARCHAR(300)
);

-- Sample Query: Number of Movies vs TV Shows
SELECT type, COUNT(*) FROM netflix GROUP BY type;

-- Sample Query: Most Common Rating
WITH RatingCounts AS (
    SELECT type, rating, COUNT(*) AS rating_count
    FROM netflix
    GROUP BY type, rating
),
RankedRatings AS (
    SELECT type, rating, rating_count,
           RANK() OVER (PARTITION BY type ORDER BY rating_count DESC) AS rank
    FROM RatingCounts
)
SELECT type, rating AS most_frequent_rating
FROM RankedRatings
WHERE rank = 1;
````
